# 🐭 MicroMouse Maze Solver

This project involves programming a **MicroMouse** robot using **Python** to autonomously navigate through a maze. The goal of the MicroMouse is to reach the center of a maze as quickly and efficiently as possible by utilizing sensors, algorithms, and real-time decision making.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The MicroMouse robot is equipped with sensors to detect walls and its environment. I used Python to control the robot’s movement, interpret sensor data, and implement maze-solving algorithms such as:

- **Wall-following**
- **Flood-fill algorithm**
- **Dead-end filling**

Python scripts communicate with the MicroMouse via serial communication, sending motion commands and receiving sensor feedback to update the robot's position and pathfinding logic.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time maze exploration and mapping
- Adaptive decision-making based on surroundings
- Path optimization to minimize run time
- Debugging interface for live sensor data and movement tracking

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- PySerial for communication
- MicroMouse hardware platform (e.g., Arduino-based or custom MCU)
- Simulation environment (optional: use of tools like PyGame or Webots)
